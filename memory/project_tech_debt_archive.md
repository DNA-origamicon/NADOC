History for [[tech-debt-ledger]] (`memory/project_tech_debt.md`). Closed entries land here with
their resolution intact. **Do not read this file in a routine `/audit-debt` pass** — the head
carries everything an open item needs. Open it only to mine one named past resolution.

### ~~Advanced/seamless scaffold routing is hash-seed non-deterministic~~ — FIXED 2026-07-13
- **Resolution (verified 2026-07-13):** the `(len(adj[n]), n)` lex tiebreaker is now applied to
  **both** the starter sort and the neighbor key handed to `_ham_path_search`
  ([seamed_router.py:296](backend/core/seamed_router.py#L296)); the in-code
  `FIXME(advanced-routing-nondeterminism)` is gone. `test_seamless_router.py::
  test_teeth_closing_zig` passes **8/8 fresh `PYTHONHASHSEED` values** (was ~4/8).
  Routing is deterministic run-to-run again. **Invariant: keep the tiebreaker on BOTH keys** —
  dropping either silently reintroduces run-to-run scaffold-strand-count drift (this
  regressed once already, via the 2026-06-01 budgeted-DFS refactor).
- **Historical detail (why it happened)** — kept because it regressed once and could again:
- **Where it was:** [seamed_router.py](backend/core/seamed_router.py) `_ham_path_ending`
  (~line 291) + the neighbor key it hands to `_ham_path_search`. Both sorted by
  `len(adj[n])` with **no secondary `n` tiebreaker**, so equal-degree nodes kept
  their set-derived (hash-seed-dependent) order.
- **Why it was debt:** the Hamiltonian path → scaffold routing came out differently
  run-to-run. `auto_scaffold_seamless` / `auto_scaffold_advanced_seamed` emitted a
  **different scaffold-strand count** depending on `PYTHONHASHSEED`. Real-app impact:
  the same design routed differently on different backend runs (not just tests).
- **Repro (2026-06-04, now stale):** `tests/test_seamless_router.py::test_teeth_closing_zig`
  (asserts exact `bridge_xovers==6`, `scaf_strands==4`) was **flaky ~50%** — 4 pass /
  4 fail across 8 fresh processes. Also varied `advanced_seamed` on teeth between 1
  and 4 scaffolds (originally misattributed to the live app rewriting the fixture).
- **History:** `seamless_router._ham_path_ending` (its OWN copy) deliberately used
  `(len(adj[n]), n)` WITH the `n` tiebreaker to avoid exactly this (documented in
  [[seamless-scaffold-router-architecture-and-hard-won-lessons]]). The
  2026-06-01 budgeted-DFS refactor that delegated the search to the shared
  `seamed_router._ham_path_search` dropped the tiebreaker → regression. The fix
  restored it on both keys.
- **Topology check on the fix:** teeth routing topology is unchanged
  (`bridge_xovers==6`, `scaf_strands==4`) — that is exactly what the now-deterministic
  test asserts, so the tiebreaker picked the same path the good seeds always picked.
  It de-flaked the test without moving the route.

### ~~Overhang Bind/Unbind button (legacy OverhangBinding pair model)~~ — REMOVED 2026-06-30
- **Where:** [overhang_sequences_panel.js](frontend/src/ui/overhang_sequences_panel.js).
- **Resolution (2026-06-30, final):** the per-row Bind/Unbind toggle was **removed entirely**
  — user feedback: mixing bind/relax actions between the Overhangs list and the Overhang
  Connections section was a bad idea; keep each section's job separate. (A short-lived
  intermediate version rewired the toggle to the unified relax; that was scrapped.)
- **Replaced by a LINK ICON:** for any overhang that participates in a connection (a
  `overhang_bindings` / `overhang_connections` / `connection_versions` entry — see pure
  `connectionPairForOverhang(design, ovhgId)`), the last column shows a chain-link button.
  Click → `openConnectionForPair(a, b)` (new export from
  [overhang_connections_panel.js](frontend/src/ui/overhang_connections_panel.js)) which
  expands the Connections section, sets the A/B dropdowns to the pair, and selects the
  pair's **applied** ConnectionVersion (falling back to the live linker/binding row).
  Imported directly (singleton entry point) → **no main.js change**. All bind/unbind /
  relax lives in the Connections section only.
- **Keystone backend fix (kept):** `crud.patch_overhang_binding` passes `driver_side`
  (from `target.driver_oh_id`) into `compute_bind_topology`, so toggling a UNIFIED
  same-rigid-body root-to-root binding's `bound` flag no longer 422s on the same-cluster
  guard. This now serves the Connections section's **Bound checkbox** (the proper home of
  bind/unbind), NOT the removed sidebar button. Legacy bindings (`driver_oh_id=None`)
  unchanged. Pin: `test_direct_connection_unified.py::
  test_unbind_then_rebind_roundtrips_same_body_unified_binding` (proven red without it).
- **Note:** the OverhangBinding model is NOT abandoned — it IS the current unified direct
  connection record (see [[overhang-connections-panel]]). The old "superseded by oh_binder"
  framing was stale.
- **NOT hand-driven in-app** (manual-validation debt): the link icon (appears for connected
  overhangs, click opens the Connections section on the applied version) is pinned by jsdom
  but not exercised against a real overhang-bearing design in the running app.

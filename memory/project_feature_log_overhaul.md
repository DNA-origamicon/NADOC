# Feature Log Overhaul + Tabbed Sidebar (commit 873f3e6, branch feature-log-update, 2026-05-02)

## Current delivery status (2026-10-16)

**Mandatory progress reporting (user request, October 16):** after every major
engineering update, report completed / estimated total, remaining, changes since
the previous report, and why scope changed. Baseline B1 is **17 / 38 complete**,
**21 remaining (12 core-priority, 9 parked assets/provenance)** through `2c15e747`.
The stable FH-01–FH-38 milestone ledger and exit criteria are in the
[delivery map](../docs/audits/feature_history_20261014/remaining_standard_part_checkpoints.md#progress-baseline-and-mandatory-update-counts--october-16-2026).
These are completed implementation milestones, some gated, not percentages of
user-ready functionality or time. Assemblies and machine-specific VR validation
are excluded; desktop qualification is included. Planning/test reruns/commits do
not earn extra credit. Keep the baseline fixed, log every estimate change, and
decrement completed if an exit reopens. Flag three major checkpoints spent on
any still-open milestone (cumulative even across alternating work), or total
growth to 42 (more than 10% over B1).
Update the ledger and these current counts before each major final response.
Engineering update U2 closed **FH-19 after two checkpoints**. Current
counts are **18 / 38 complete, 20 remaining (11 core, 9 parked)**, delta
for latest update U6 **+0 completed, +0 total**. U6 is **FH-18 checkpoint 4**:
ordinary authored PATCH, admitted identity-group dissolution and auxiliary
recording are implemented; private separate organization/native replay now also
works. Live transactions, consumer/UI migration and new-group movement keep FH-18 open.
**Task growth is flagged.** The containment decision and five finite batches are
in the [organization/placement migration plan](../docs/audits/feature_history_20261014/group_placement_migration_plan.md).
Separate organizational membership from the existing ordered placement list;
preserve that list as the sole numerical authority and expose its owners as
editable placement features. No hidden replacement group, per-residue expansion
or coordinate baking. New-group move/frame/extension semantics remain a required
integration exit. Private conversion → posed dissolve → regroup is implemented;
finish its owned transaction and consumer/UI adapters next. Do not
inflate counts by splitting batches or accumulate more identity-only subsets.
No total-growth trigger or estimate change; the full original FH-18 exit stands.

**FH-18 U6 representation checkpoint:** migration batch A is implemented privately.
`Design.group_organization` is either legacy `None` or a closed version-1 wrapper
of typed `PartGroup`/`GroupDomainRef` metadata. Its `part_group` resource namespace
is distinct from the unchanged numerical `cluster` owners. Conversion derives
group metadata from the rebuilt prefix and checks complete ordered placement IDs;
it does not pin poses. `group-organize/create/update/dissolve` v1 are top-level
Snapshot commands. Native organization edits preserve all ordered placement inputs
and derived geometry; earlier pose edits regenerate through them. Creator output
IDs and conversion output namespace are protected, consumer references editable.
No Fine Routing child can carry these commands while its diff omits the wrapper.

Typed identity/remap/structure inventories include organization; legacy None adds
no strand walk. The exact oxDNA archive schema still admits legacy documents and
explicitly refuses active organization. Unadapted generated composition/removal
and native authoring refuse; pose-only existing placement and three qualified
numerical families preserve metadata privately. Live load/startup restore,
loadout navigation, publication, save acknowledgement, undo/redo and ordinary
writes refuse active organization before side effects. There is no public switch.
This is a staging boundary, not a sandbox against arbitrary privileged Python.

Recovery substitutes the selected snapshot's wrapper, including F0 and actual
33-row optimized seek. Capture/cold proof carries the authoring field independently
of recovery payloads. Missing/evicted organization-body admission, the rest of the
consumer matrix, live transaction/repair paths, visible Groups/Placements and
new-group move semantics remain B–E work. All milestone exits remain unchanged.
Before serialization, metadata admission charges each group and domain-reference
occurrence so shared-container aliases cannot hide expanded JSON work. Bounds
remain 30k metadata nodes/2 MB, 2k groups; source identity indexes each admit at
most 30k records. These are not latency/heap measurements.

All three historical numerical-schema generations have exact direct edges to the
new current targets: nine entries/10,989 bytes under unchanged 16-entry/16KiB limits.
Prior historical-target policy is retained byte-for-byte for audit/tests. Numerical
kernels, data and runtime checks are unchanged; no stored pins rewritten. See
[U6 evidence](../docs/audits/feature_history_20261014/validation_group_organization_representation.json).
Related backend regression: **978 passed**, 176 warnings, 39.85 s; 159 cases in six
new organization test files. **Three real native-worker cases passed** in 72.95 s.
No frontend production change; `main.js` delta 0.
App/desktop/latency acceptance remains open; Archive is not mounted. Detailed
native-worker, selector and cleanup results are recorded in the U6 evidence.
Selector dry-run ran no suite; aggregate fast/FULL debt remains. Repo-wide memory
lint has six pre-existing unrelated errors; this active head is bounded and indexed.

## Working boundaries and next step

Prioritize ordinary extrude, sweep, bend, twist, move/rotate and Fine Routing
resize/ligate/nick/crossover/loop-skip workflows. A registered builder is not a
finished tool: recording, preview/cancel/Apply, downstream editing, undo/reload
and ordinary controls must agree. Nanoparticle/protein/assets and their remaining
benchmarks are parked; ordinary DNA connections are core. Assemblies and VR
remain separately deferred. The persistent P3–P6 goal stays active.

Next: continue migration batch B through the owned group transaction and explicit
placement selection. Keep batch C's complete consumer inventory in view; do not
enable active organization until B/C/D adapters and E's applicable checks pass.
Research unresolved CAD workflow decisions before choosing semantics. Any
scientific placement change still requires the separate demonstrated-geometry
authorization process. Commit/push reversible checkpoints; no numerical repins.

Preserve the division between input proof, snapshot recovery, structural validity,
scientific validation and user editability. Full proof is explicit/background
work, never a slider or drag-frame operation. Keep source/session/revision/policy
ownership through private evaluation and one failure-atomic publication. Do not
silently bless imported roots or opaque generated receipts as native recipes.

Current architecture and finite work maps:

- [Architecture review](../docs/audits/feature_history_20261014/architecture_review.md)
- [Fixed milestone ledger](../docs/audits/feature_history_20261014/remaining_standard_part_checkpoints.md)
- [Organization/placement migration](../docs/audits/feature_history_20261014/group_placement_migration_plan.md)
- [Implementation ledger](../docs/audits/feature_history_20261014/implementation.md)
- [Historical implementation, recovery semantics and prior validation](project_feature_log_overhaul_archive.md)

The archive retains the earlier Fine Routing, delete/revert, snapshot seek,
identity lifetime and generated-feature notes. Read the relevant section before
changing those mechanisms; the current ledger supersedes old completion claims.
